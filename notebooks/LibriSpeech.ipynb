            "[24:16.040 --> 24:21.880]  We were so thrilled to have a child because we hadn't been able to conceive.\n",
            "[24:21.880 --> 24:25.440]  We thought we were going to have to adopt a little German baby boy.\n",
            "[24:25.440 --> 24:30.840]  After a long two day labor, Kristen was born.\n",
            "[24:30.840 --> 24:34.280]  Stan went to breakfast with our good friends and said the answer to world population is\n",
            "[24:34.280 --> 24:39.240]  the men should have the children and there would only be one for a family.\n",
            "[24:39.240 --> 24:42.160]  Betty didn't share that with you.\n",
            "[24:42.160 --> 24:49.280]  And then we decided to return back to the U.S. after we had been there just about three\n",
            "[24:49.280 --> 24:51.880]  years overseas.\n",
            "[24:51.880 --> 24:52.880]  Wonderful experience.\n",
            "[24:52.880 --> 24:57.520]  Little girl that we brought home seemed like she would almost fit in a shoe box.\n",
            "[24:57.520 --> 25:00.480]  We had what everybody expects when you go to Germany.\n",
            "[25:00.480 --> 25:06.400]  You come back with a Volkswagen, a Kuku clock and a child.\n",
            "[25:06.400 --> 25:07.400]  So there we go.\n",
            "[25:07.400 --> 25:09.200]  We had all three.\n",
            "[25:09.200 --> 25:15.920]  We came back and he got a job just outside of Yuba City at a high school as a counselor.\n",
            "[25:15.920 --> 25:20.880]  I guess the first priority of business was just kind of getting settled in Kristen.\n",
            "[25:20.880 --> 25:24.640]  She cried a lot.\n",
            "[25:24.640 --> 25:27.680]  And as it turned out, she was allergic to milk.\n",
            "[25:27.680 --> 25:32.680]  Fortunately, about nine months we figured it out and she turned into a kid that you really\n",
            "[25:32.680 --> 25:35.680]  wanted to keep.\n",
            "[25:35.680 --> 25:37.160]  And she was my chap here.\n",
            "[25:37.160 --> 25:42.360]  As she got older, sort of feeling a sense of invincibility and she could do anything she\n",
            "[25:42.360 --> 25:43.360]  wanted to do.\n",
            "[25:43.360 --> 25:44.360]  She walked very early.\n",
            "[25:44.360 --> 25:45.840]  She talked very early.\n",
            "[25:45.840 --> 25:48.160]  She was like on a mission really.\n",
            "[25:48.160 --> 25:49.920]  She knew what she wanted to do.\n",
            "[25:49.920 --> 25:55.440]  And a lot of kids are that way, but that big zest for life like holy moe, I can do\n",
            "[25:55.440 --> 25:57.920]  anything, you know, kind of like that.\n",
            "[25:57.920 --> 26:03.400]  In October 1979, the smart second child, Matthew, was born.\n",
            "[26:03.400 --> 26:07.480]  Initially if you're the only child you're sort of the center of the universe.\n",
            "[26:07.480 --> 26:11.280]  And then when the second child comes along, you need to have a doll or something to play\n",
            "[26:11.280 --> 26:14.520]  with since you're no longer the center of the universe.\n",
            "[26:14.520 --> 26:19.800]  And she so embraced having a brother.\n",
            "[26:19.800 --> 26:20.800]  I remember her in the hospital.\n",
            "[26:20.800 --> 26:22.800]  It's like, where are his shoes?\n",
            "[26:22.800 --> 26:26.760]  And I said, well, he doesn't need any shoes.\n",
            "[26:26.760 --> 26:27.760]  He doesn't walk it.\n",
            "[26:27.760 --> 26:28.760]  When is he going to walk?\n",
            "[26:28.760 --> 26:32.720]  And I said, well, it's going to be a while.\n",
            "[26:32.720 --> 26:36.720]  And I've seen other families where a new child comes in when that child is two and they want\n",
            "[26:36.720 --> 26:38.360]  nothing to do with that child.\n",
            "[26:38.360 --> 26:44.240]  And she was, well, you had to stop her from smothering the boy because she was just on\n",
            "[26:44.240 --> 26:46.160]  him, just on him.\n",
            "[26:46.160 --> 26:48.280]  So that started very early.\n",
            "[26:48.280 --> 26:54.800]  Finally, in January 1982, Lindsay, the last of the three smart children, was born.\n",
            "[26:54.800 --> 27:00.000]  And then, you know, the third child, so then we were a complete family having three children,\n",
            "[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  you know, two girls and a boy.\n",
            "[27:02.000 --> 27:08.040]  And then of course, Lindsay was little and a brother at that point can really be a pain.\n",
            "[27:08.040 --> 27:09.040]  So it's like, well, good.\n",
            "[27:09.040 --> 27:10.120]  I've got someone who'll do it.\n",
            "[27:10.120 --> 27:11.120]  I tell them to do.\n",
            "[27:11.120 --> 27:15.560]  Being the eldest child, I think she was an overachiever, meaning she did things to please\n",
            "[27:15.640 --> 27:17.440]  her mom and dad.\n",
            "[27:17.440 --> 27:19.600]  In school, she worked hard to have good grades.\n",
            "[27:19.600 --> 27:21.760]  And I think you find that true.\n",
            "[27:21.760 --> 27:27.480]  Most families, when there's more than one child, the eldest one, parents really sort of focus\n",
            "[27:27.480 --> 27:33.440]  on that child initially, you know, getting a school and working and so on and forth.\n",
            "[27:33.440 --> 27:35.440]  So she met that.\n",
            "[27:35.440 --> 27:36.440]  And she was always the organizer.\n",
            "[27:36.440 --> 27:40.840]  It's like I said before, she periodically thinks she was a teacher and line them all\n",
            "[27:40.840 --> 27:43.040]  up and make them sit and she tell them what to do.\n",
            "[27:43.040 --> 27:47.040]  Sometimes they do it, sometimes they won't do it.\n",
            "[27:47.040 --> 27:54.680]  And then she set up her little church service and make them sit and pray and sometimes it\n",
            "[27:54.680 --> 27:57.280]  work, sometimes it didn't work.\n",
            "[27:57.280 --> 28:02.880]  In home videos, you can see an active and engaged big sister playing with her siblings\n",
            "[28:02.880 --> 28:10.880]  in the snow and on beaches, running lemonade stands and singing Christmas carols.\n",
            "[28:10.880 --> 28:17.760]  As she grew up, Kristen participated in school plays, soccer games and swim tournaments.\n",
            "[28:17.760 --> 28:21.920]  On a cruise, she learned to make omelets the way the ships cook did.\n",
            "[28:21.920 --> 28:26.460]  And back at home started a routine of making them for her family on Sunday mornings, even\n",
            "[28:26.460 --> 28:29.800]  though she mostly avoided eating egg yolks.\n",
            "[28:29.800 --> 28:34.560]  She spent time in London with friends, Ann Van Azuela, where she was a foreign exchange\n",
            "[28:34.560 --> 28:37.040]  student for a summer.\n",
            "[28:37.040 --> 28:42.840]  When she smiles at the camera, her dark eyes narrow with genuine warmth.\n",
            "[28:42.840 --> 28:47.880]  She was close with both of her parents.\n",
            "[28:47.880 --> 28:54.600]  She joined me in doing things, although I think her interests are more in line with\n",
            "[28:54.600 --> 28:55.960]  her mother.\n",
            "[28:55.960 --> 29:01.800]  My interests are quite a bit outdoors in doing things outside and camping and going places.\n",
            "[29:01.800 --> 29:07.440]  So she always enjoyed going when we go to Yosemite or if we go to the beach.\n",
            "[29:07.440 --> 29:11.000]  So she liked water and she liked travel, things that we did that way.\n",
            "[29:11.000 --> 29:16.760]  I think that was part of her makeup, loved travel extensively, and the globe is their\n",

            "[29:18.040 --> 29:21.120]  So I think she had those values.\n",
            "[29:21.120 --> 29:24.400]  I think she was always kind of finding her sense.\n",
            "[29:24.400 --> 29:29.240]  I think this is important for a lot of parents to understand is that continuity in a child's\n",
            "[29:29.240 --> 29:32.000]  life is really important.\n",
            "[29:32.000 --> 29:35.480]  So we moved from Yuba City as she came here in fourth grade.\n",
            "[29:35.480 --> 29:39.960]  Fourth grades, they think they're pretty hot stuff, fourth graders.\n",
            "[29:39.960 --> 29:43.880]  And you have to break into the group.\n",
            "[29:43.880 --> 29:52.240]  So she did the standard birthday thing, so she was embraced by her friends and pulled\n",
            "[29:52.240 --> 29:53.640]  into it.\n",
            "[29:53.640 --> 29:56.200]  And then they kind of changed the boundaries on the school.\n",
            "[29:56.200 --> 29:57.960]  So that kind of upset the apple cart.\n",
            "[29:57.960 --> 30:00.160]  So you have to find new friends then.\n",
            "[30:00.160 --> 30:06.120]  And then they went back to Mabel Baron and she reconnected with the friends that she\n",
            "[30:06.120 --> 30:08.040]  had made earlier.\n",
            "[30:08.040 --> 30:11.840]  So I would say she wasn't the leader of the group, she wasn't the leader of the pack,\n",
            "[30:11.840 --> 30:13.360]  but she was certainly not quiet.\n",
            "[30:13.360 --> 30:15.040]  She was just part of the group.\n",
            "[30:15.040 --> 30:21.520]  I meet one of Kristen's closest friends, Anne Marie, for breakfast while I'm in Stockton.\n",
            "[30:21.520 --> 30:26.600]  Afterwards we sit in my car, facing the Stockton Marina, while she flips through a photo album\n",
            "[30:26.600 --> 30:28.360]  to show me pictures.\n",
            "[30:28.360 --> 30:31.040]  And I ask her to tell me about her friend.\n",
            "[30:31.040 --> 30:33.200]  Okay, is it on?\n",
            "[30:33.200 --> 30:35.800]  It is, yeah.\n",

            "[30:44.200 --> 30:49.400]  And we're really good friends in fifth, sixth grade and on seventh and eighth grade and\n",
            "[30:49.400 --> 30:53.160]  stayed in touch through high school, even though we went to different high schools for\n",
            "[30:53.160 --> 30:54.560]  a while.\n",
            "[30:54.560 --> 31:01.920]  My most memorable memories of her and I was young kids stuff playing at each other's\n",

            "[31:10.240 --> 31:15.000]  I remember being at her house a lot, you know, first you'd sleep over at your friend's house\n",
            "[31:15.000 --> 31:19.120]  and, you know, making cookies and making popcorn and watching movies.\n",
            "[31:19.120 --> 31:22.800]  And I just loved her parents and her sister and her brother.\n",
            "[31:22.800 --> 31:24.560]  And our families knew each other.\n",
            "[31:24.560 --> 31:27.800]  And you were just for, you know, these really good childhood friends.\n",
            "[31:27.800 --> 31:35.120]  And we went through sixth grade graduation and eighth grade promotion graduation together.\n",
            "[31:35.120 --> 31:37.240]  She had a lot of vibrancy.\n",
            "[31:37.240 --> 31:40.760]  You can see from photos, she has this wonderful smile and a laughter.\n",
            "[31:40.760 --> 31:42.800]  She appreciated humor.\n",
            "[31:42.800 --> 31:47.080]  A lot of, you know, memories come back when I look at pictures of us, pictures of us.\n",
            "[31:47.080 --> 31:52.120]  And sixth grade just being goofy at the pool or at the, this thing called the beach\n",
            "[31:52.120 --> 31:56.560]  club where kids would go and there was a pool and like a little beach.\n",
            "[31:56.560 --> 31:58.160]  And you just go and hang out.\n",
            "[31:58.160 --> 32:02.960]  It's like sixth grade kids, like what we were like 12 years old probably.\n",
            "[32:02.960 --> 32:09.040]  And I remember her love of drawing, especially like architecture and homes.\n",

            "[32:10.040 --> 32:14.760]  I remember she would show me, I have this memory of being over her house when we went\n",

            "[32:15.760 --> 32:18.640]  She was showing me some of her new drawings, some of her new architecture, the houses that\n",
            "[32:18.640 --> 32:20.280]  she would like lay out and map them out.\n",
            "[32:20.280 --> 32:22.120]  And there was so much attention to detail.\n",
            "[32:22.120 --> 32:24.360]  And she had such a gift.\n",
            "[32:24.360 --> 32:28.920]  And I remember that's why she, in my memory, that's why she went.\n",
            "[32:28.920 --> 32:34.280]  Joe's cow poly to go to because they had such a good architecture program.\n",

            "[32:37.160 --> 32:41.960]  She, you know, she had a great smile, a great laugh.\n",
            "[32:42.960 --> 32:48.440]  I just remember lots of laughter and having a good time, you know, and just doing your\n",
            "[32:48.440 --> 32:51.240]  normal everyday kid things, never getting into trouble.\n",
            "[32:51.240 --> 32:55.840]  I mean, we were pretty innocent.\n",
            "[32:55.840 --> 32:57.680]  We were in Girl Scouts together.\n",
            "[32:57.680 --> 32:59.160]  She was a wonderful friend.\n",
            "[32:59.160 --> 33:02.400]  She was, I would still imagine that we would be friends today.\n",
            "[33:02.400 --> 33:03.680]  I have no doubt we would.\n",
            "[33:03.680 --> 33:09.080]  I'm still friends with her family and where she here, I could imagine our kids playing\n",
            "[33:09.080 --> 33:13.160]  together, you know, which we back living close to where we are.\n",
            "[33:13.160 --> 33:17.800]  I don't know, but it's just not fair.\n",
            "[33:17.800 --> 33:19.600]  She should be here.\n",
            "[33:19.600 --> 33:24.040]  And she's, you know, amazing person.\n",
            "[33:24.040 --> 33:33.720]  And I just, I've struggled with it for so long.\n",
            "[33:33.720 --> 33:37.080]  Stan worked as the principal of Vintage High School in Napa.\n",
            "[33:37.080 --> 33:42.360]  And because of the long commutes, wasn't able to spend much time at home in Stockton.\n",
            "[33:42.360 --> 33:48.400]  So in her junior year, Kristen decided to switch schools, leaving her friends behind\n",
            "[33:48.400 --> 33:51.080]  to spend more time with her dad.\n",
            "[33:51.080 --> 33:56.040]  I think that was a difficult year for her because, you know, I reflected on when I went\n",
            "[33:56.040 --> 34:02.280]  to high school, I remember the principal's son was a student during the time that I was\n",
            "[34:02.280 --> 34:04.000]  going to high school.\n",
            "[34:04.000 --> 34:09.360]  And I thought about, you know, I think it was very, very hard for her to, you know,\n",
            "[34:09.360 --> 34:16.560]  meet her dad's standards for his high school in Napa, Vintage High School.\n",
            "[34:16.560 --> 34:19.000]  We didn't have a home that we were living in.\n",
            "[34:19.000 --> 34:24.800]  We moved around and through rotary that a lot of the rotarians, and I had been a rotarian,\n",
            "[34:24.800 --> 34:28.280]  provided us with places to stay when they were traveling.\n",
            "[34:28.280 --> 34:32.600]  We stayed in some beautiful homes, house sitting.\n",
            "[34:32.600 --> 34:36.160]  And also I rented some places.\n",
            "[34:36.160 --> 34:41.840]  We might be, you know, in one location for a week or a few days.\n",
            "[34:41.840 --> 34:43.480]  And I think that was difficult for her.\n",
            "[34:43.480 --> 34:45.960]  We didn't always have a bed to sleep in.\n",
            "[34:45.960 --> 34:48.920]  Sometimes we slept in sleeping bags.\n",
            "[34:48.920 --> 34:52.400]  And so we had a lot of time in the morning and then we went to school.\n",
            "[34:52.400 --> 34:55.960]  And then we afterwards go out to dinner somewhere.\n",
            "[34:55.960 --> 35:01.840]  I really didn't have the facility to cook there later I did.\n",
            "[35:01.840 --> 35:09.080]  But I think it was difficult for her to socialize in that she didn't have a place to meet friends\n",
            "[35:09.080 --> 35:14.520]  or, you know, communicate very well other than at school at the time.\n",
            "[35:14.520 --> 35:19.840]  So she stuck that out for a year, which was a bit trying on her, maybe on me a little\n",
            "[35:19.840 --> 35:21.240]  bit.\n",
            "[35:21.240 --> 35:26.920]  And then she came back home to mom and completed over here at Lincoln High School in Stockton.\n",
            "[35:26.920 --> 35:31.560]  In her last year of high school, Kristen reconnected with her old friends.\n",
            "[35:31.560 --> 35:32.560]  Like Roxy.\n",
            "[35:32.560 --> 35:37.760]  I think probably I was, I was her, her closest, longest friend.\n",
            "[35:37.760 --> 35:39.280]  So she was friends with my sister.\n",
            "[35:39.280 --> 35:41.000]  My sister was in her grade.\n",
            "[35:41.000 --> 35:46.440]  I'd say she was probably one of the best friends you can ask for.\n",
            "[35:46.440 --> 35:55.000]  Just a very kind, polite, caring, shy girl.\n",
            "[35:55.000 --> 36:00.480]  She helped me with my homework a lot.\n",
            "[36:00.480 --> 36:02.960]  She was really, really, really smart.\n",
            "[36:02.960 --> 36:07.520]  Some of the funnest memories we have are her parents would take her and I to Yosemite and\n",
            "[36:07.520 --> 36:10.560]  we'd climb, you know, climb her hike.\n",
            "[36:10.560 --> 36:15.400]  Kristen loved to shop and we would go to the spree outlet, which was really fun.\n",
            "[36:15.400 --> 36:19.000]  You know, as a little kid or just a, you know, a young girl.\n",
            "[36:19.000 --> 36:25.880]  It's a big basically warehouse of just boxes and boxes of discount clothing.\n",
            "[36:25.880 --> 36:29.280]  She used to share her clothes with me.\n",
            "[36:29.280 --> 36:34.720]  And she was always so sweet about it, you know.\n",
            "[36:34.720 --> 36:37.760]  She loved Bob Marley, Tom Petty.\n",
            "[36:37.760 --> 36:38.800]  She even liked rap.\n",
            "[36:38.800 --> 36:41.280]  My sister and I would pick her up.\n",
            "[36:41.280 --> 36:43.800]  I don't think she had a car in high school.\n",
            "[36:43.800 --> 36:47.360]  So my sister was always the DJ of all of our music.\n",
            "[36:47.360 --> 36:52.280]  And some of the songs that we played, you know, Kristen would get a just smile thinking about\n",
            "[36:52.280 --> 36:56.080]  it because she'd get all, you know, embarrassed, you know, kind of or just, because we would\n",
            "[36:56.080 --> 37:00.440]  play some of the, you know, more graphic songs.\n",
            "[37:00.440 --> 37:03.720]  But she was really shy, really shy.\n",
            "[37:03.720 --> 37:09.160]  Kristen, Denise Smart.\n",
            "[37:09.160 --> 37:14.800]  After graduating from Lincoln High School on June 8, 1995, Kristen traveled to the island\n",
            "[37:14.800 --> 37:21.120]  of Oahu to work as a camp counselor and lifeguard at Camp Mokulea Iya.\n",
            "[37:21.120 --> 37:24.720]  Over what no one knew would be the last summer of her life.\n",
            "[37:24.720 --> 37:26.320]  Kristen, you hear me?\n",
            "[37:26.320 --> 37:31.040]  I tracked down Rachel Bird, who shared a cabin with Kristen at Mokulea Iya that summer.\n",
            "[37:31.040 --> 37:32.800]  Kristen was my co-councer at Camp.\n",
            "[37:32.800 --> 37:38.000]  And so I spent every single day with her morning, noon and night for three months or whatever\n",
            "[37:38.000 --> 37:39.000]  it was.\n",
            "[37:39.000 --> 37:41.120]  You are told who's in your cabin.\n",
            "[37:41.120 --> 37:45.480]  There's younger cabin, you know, medium-age cabin and older cabin.\n",
            "[37:45.480 --> 37:48.960]  So we took care of the youngest kids for a whole summer.\n",
            "[37:48.960 --> 37:52.400]  And Kristen and I got placed together, meeting her.\n",
            "[37:52.400 --> 37:54.160]  She was a tall, beautiful one.\n",
            "[37:54.240 --> 37:56.720]  Surfer girl, like, really chill.\n",
            "[37:56.720 --> 38:00.120]  Only, gosh, four or five weeks after summer camp, it started.\n",
            "[38:00.120 --> 38:01.120]  My cousin passed away.\n",
            "[38:01.120 --> 38:03.360]  And she had a heart problem and she passed.\n",
            "[38:03.360 --> 38:08.800]  And I remember Kristen being somewhere that actually was a big support to me during that\n",
            "[38:08.800 --> 38:12.240]  time because it was really, my cousin was like a sister to me.\n",
            "[38:12.240 --> 38:16.560]  She was always there for me and I think there's actually a picture at one of our Aloha ceremonies.\n",
            "[38:16.560 --> 38:19.560]  And there's a picture where I'm crying and Kristen's hugging me.\n",
            "[38:19.560 --> 38:21.360]  And she was just a sweet girl, you know.\n",
            "[38:21.360 --> 38:23.000]  She was definitely like the Surfer girl.\n",
            "[38:23.000 --> 38:24.920]  She loved being out in the water.\n",
            "[38:24.920 --> 38:28.760]  Anytime she could go circuit rest period or anything like that, she wanted to be out there\n",
            "[38:28.760 --> 38:31.680]  doing that.\n",
            "[38:31.680 --> 38:33.720]  I remember doing hair rafts on her hair.\n",
            "[38:33.720 --> 38:36.080]  She was just that very like, earthy.\n",
            "[38:36.080 --> 38:39.880]  I wouldn't want to say like, flower child, but like that kind of like, yeah, like nothing\n",
            "[38:39.880 --> 38:41.520]  ever seemed to get there.\n",
            "[38:41.520 --> 38:42.520]  Calm and collected.\n",
            "[38:42.520 --> 38:43.920]  You know, we were both tall.\n",
            "[38:43.920 --> 38:48.680]  I'm tall and hefty and she was tall and skinny but it was joked that like the two of us were\n",
            "[38:48.680 --> 38:49.680]  the twin towers.\n",
            "[38:49.760 --> 38:51.240]  We were both so tall.\n",
            "[38:51.240 --> 38:55.800]  We were both over like, you know, six feet ish and her legs went up to like my shoulders\n",
            "[38:55.800 --> 39:00.240]  and my legs went to like her knees because I'm tall but with the short legs and she just\n",
            "[39:00.240 --> 39:03.280]  had these legs for days and she was gorgeous, right?\n",
            "[39:03.280 --> 39:06.520]  Like anybody would be around and she'd be the person that's not being automatically\n",
            "[39:06.520 --> 39:11.040]  your eyes would go straight to Kristen because she just had that look.\n",
            "[39:11.040 --> 39:16.960]  We'd go to Waimea and we'd get shaped by the kids.\n",
            "[39:16.960 --> 39:19.920]  Which is fun zone 24-7, right?\n",
            "[39:19.920 --> 39:25.760]  Um, where I was more kind of the nurturing mother's side to you is very like mellow.\n",
            "[39:25.760 --> 39:26.760]  It's all good.\n",
            "[39:26.760 --> 39:27.760]  It's good.\n",
            "[39:27.760 --> 39:28.760]  Like we're good.\n",
            "[39:28.760 --> 39:36.160]  When you were there, it was all about just being in Hawaii, being at the beach.\n",
            "[39:36.160 --> 39:43.320]  We have pictures of being out front of our cabin, all of us dancing on a picnic table.\n",
            "[39:43.320 --> 39:46.800]  You know, we were young and it was fun, you know?\n",
            "[39:47.800 --> 39:52.320]  And then winter reunion, we had a winter reunion like between Christmas and New Year.\n",
            "[39:52.320 --> 39:54.720]  I think actually went over New Year's.\n",
            "[39:54.720 --> 39:57.720]  It's a smaller version of camp, not as many kids.\n",
            "[39:57.720 --> 40:03.000]  And then we were getting ready to go back in June to be a counselor's camp.\n",
            "[40:03.000 --> 40:06.720]  And I know she'd been hired because I was working at the camp and we were going to be\n",
            "[40:06.720 --> 40:09.680]  co-councer again and that whole summer was kind of this.\n",
            "[40:09.680 --> 40:10.680]  Well, where is she?\n",
            "[40:10.680 --> 40:11.680]  Is she somewhere?\n",
            "[40:11.680 --> 40:12.680]  Did she go somewhere?\n",
            "[40:12.680 --> 40:17.120]  You're just dancing through life and then all of a sudden something stops it and somebody's\n",
            "[40:17.120 --> 40:20.200]  gone and it's like, wait, but I want to hold on to those memories.\n",
            "[40:20.200 --> 40:24.120]  Like, I want to remember every moment because I didn't know there weren't going to be any\n",
            "[40:24.120 --> 40:34.800]  more moments.\n",
            "[40:34.800 --> 40:39.800]  Focused on her academics, but struggling with mild ADD, Kristen had doubled up her workload\n",
            "[40:39.800 --> 40:41.960]  to graduate a semester early.\n",
            "[40:41.960 --> 40:46.640]  Attending San Joaquin Delta College for extra credits to increase her chances of being\n",
            "[40:46.640 --> 40:49.880]  accepted to a four year university.\n",
            "[40:49.880 --> 40:50.960]  It worked.\n",
            "[40:50.960 --> 40:55.880]  She was accepted to UC Santa Barbara and had already paid a deposit for a dorm room there\n",
            "[40:55.880 --> 41:01.600]  when she abruptly decided that she would rather attend somewhere a little closer to home.\n",
            "[41:01.600 --> 41:07.360]  So after returning from Oahu, Kristen moved from Stockton to San Luis Obispo to study\n",
            "[41:07.360 --> 41:14.440]  at California Polytechnic State University, known to students and locals as Cal Poly,\n",
            "[41:14.440 --> 41:18.760]  where she originally intended to major in architecture, but later switched to communication\n",
            "[41:18.760 --> 41:24.800]  studies with the goal of traveling the world as a reporter like Joan London.\n",
            "[41:24.800 --> 41:28.360]  Here again, her friend Roxie from Stockton.\n",
            "[41:28.360 --> 41:30.800]  We stayed close until she left for school.\n",
            "[41:30.800 --> 41:35.800]  I don't do therapy too often, but I'm in PT right now because I just had a baby, you\n",
            "[41:35.800 --> 41:37.680]  know, some weird things have been popping up.\n",
            "[41:37.680 --> 41:41.720]  You've ever had mouth treatment before where they put your hand in your mouth?\n",
            "[41:41.720 --> 41:44.120]  They do all your muscles?\n",
            "[41:44.120 --> 41:48.360]  A memory popped back in my head maybe too because you had called me.\n",
            "[41:48.360 --> 41:52.880]  She was going off to college and she did not want to come back to Stockton.\n",
            "[41:52.880 --> 42:01.720]  She just wanted to become an architect and live overseas and kind of just become free.\n",
            "[42:01.720 --> 42:05.440]  She told me she wouldn't be calling me too much when she left for school, which was heartbreaking\n",
            "[42:05.440 --> 42:08.400]  because I was a senior at the time.\n",
            "[42:08.400 --> 42:11.360]  So I didn't talk to her when she was in school at all.\n",
            "[42:11.360 --> 42:17.080]  I guess that's kind of common when you leave a town like Stockton.\n",
            "[42:17.080 --> 42:22.680]  But the neat thing, you know, my husband said that I didn't peak in high school.\n",
            "[42:22.680 --> 42:27.040]  Well, I'd say that Kristen didn't peak in high school, you know what I'm saying?\n",
            "[42:27.040 --> 42:28.840]  She had her life to peak.\n",
            "[42:28.840 --> 42:34.280]  I think that it was her time to, you know, get her architect degree and stay the world,\n",
            "[42:34.280 --> 42:35.920]  you know.\n",
            "[42:35.920 --> 42:40.120]  Because she enrolled late, she missed her chance to get a dorm room on campus.\n",
            "[42:40.120 --> 42:46.600]  So she moved into the Stinner Glen Apartments at 1050 East Foothill Boulevard, now known\n",
            "[42:46.600 --> 42:48.480]  as the slow.\n",
            "[42:48.480 --> 42:51.760]  So she had a really nice roommate there.\n",
            "[42:51.760 --> 42:57.840]  I thought she was nice, but she came from a very small, very sheltered kind of background.\n",
            "[42:57.840 --> 43:02.520]  So it wasn't an unhappy dorm relationship.\n",
            "[43:02.520 --> 43:04.200]  She just wanted to be on campus.\n",
            "[43:04.200 --> 43:08.720]  And so her name from the get-go was on the waiting list.\n",
            "[43:08.720 --> 43:14.040]  When she returned to Cal Poly after spending Christmas 1995 with friends back at Camp Mokulea\n",
            "[43:14.040 --> 43:20.520]  Iya, she moved into room 120 at Mirahall, one of six historic residence halls known as\n",
            "[43:20.520 --> 43:22.000]  the Red bricks.\n",
            "[43:22.000 --> 43:25.960]  When she got the call that she could go, she had to give 30 days, I think, to Stinner\n",
            "[43:25.960 --> 43:26.960]  Glen.\n",
            "[43:27.960 --> 43:29.600]  And then I didn't help move her.\n",
            "[43:29.600 --> 43:35.240]  She somehow probably found someone with a car or something, but she got resettled.\n",
            "[43:35.240 --> 43:36.640]  And she said, oh, it's so much better.\n",
            "[43:36.640 --> 43:41.200]  I can walk to class because, you know, Stinner Glen is not right next door.\n",
            "[43:41.200 --> 43:46.520]  Acclimating the life on campus, Kristen worked to reinvent herself, using nicknames like\n",
            "[43:46.520 --> 43:53.040]  Kiana or Marisol in her emails, and dying her naturally blonde hair brown.\n",
            "[43:53.040 --> 43:55.560]  She still called her parents every Sunday, though.\n",
            "[43:55.560 --> 43:59.080]  And they traveled down to San Luis Obispo several times to visit her.\n",
            "[43:59.080 --> 44:05.840]  We probably went down after the Christmas holidays, and we went down after Easter vacation\n",
            "[44:05.840 --> 44:08.240]  because we'd gone on a trip with the kids.\n",
            "[44:08.240 --> 44:10.680]  That's when I saw the brown hair.\n",
            "[44:10.680 --> 44:13.640]  She told me about the brown hair in Santa Picture, but it's seeing in person.\n",
            "[44:13.640 --> 44:14.640]  I go, okay.\n",
            "[44:14.640 --> 44:16.040]  She was like all children going away.\n",
            "[44:16.040 --> 44:19.680]  They were rather independent when you get to college.\n",
            "[44:19.680 --> 44:25.120]  Myself, my wife, and yourself, and everyone else knows that, you know?\n",
            "[44:25.120 --> 44:27.640]  And it was like brown.\n",
            "[44:27.640 --> 44:34.400]  But I think, you know, sometimes kids make their hair red or green or something.\n",
            "[44:34.400 --> 44:36.040]  So how long she would have kept it?\n",
            "[44:36.040 --> 44:38.080]  I don't really know.\n",
            "[44:38.080 --> 44:42.680]  The college classes came as a bit more of a struggle for Kristen than high school had,\n",
            "[44:42.680 --> 44:45.320]  and not long after moving into Mere Hall.\n",
            "[44:45.320 --> 44:49.640]  She started to express doubts about whether Cal Poly was right for her.\n",
            "[44:49.640 --> 44:54.840]  There were other places, she told her mother, like the University of the Virgin Islands,\n",
            "[44:54.840 --> 44:58.720]  or Puerto Rico, where she could go to get a doctorate.\n",
            "[44:58.720 --> 45:04.560]  When Denise came down to visit her in early 1996, Kristen broke down, begging her mother\n",
            "[45:04.560 --> 45:07.600]  to let her drop out and go somewhere else.\n",
            "[45:07.600 --> 45:11.320]  She really felt everyone was too much the same.\n",
            "[45:11.320 --> 45:19.600]  And the reality is, freshman year is really hard year for many majority, I would say.\n",
            "[45:19.600 --> 45:24.240]  It's a huge transition, being away from home, being responsible for your laundry, and having\n",
            "[45:24.240 --> 45:25.240]  to do your homework.\n",
            "[45:25.240 --> 45:28.800]  And she was working as a lifeguard, so she tried to get as many hours as she could at\n",
            "[45:28.800 --> 45:29.800]  the pool.\n",
            "[45:29.800 --> 45:37.160]  And of course, is the newbie, which hours are open, you know, the 5 and 6 AM hours.\n",
            "[45:37.160 --> 45:40.920]  And she was like most teenagers at the time.\n",
            "[45:40.920 --> 45:43.200]  They loved their sleep.\n",
            "[45:43.200 --> 45:45.040]  So she was probably tired.\n",
            "[45:45.040 --> 45:47.040]  She was fatigued and adjusting.\n",
            "[45:48.040 --> 45:53.600]  But like I said, I don't think it's unusual for kids in their first year of college to,\n",
            "[45:53.600 --> 46:01.440]  in fact, I had a friend whose son was a year ahead of Kristen, and he was at Pepperdine.\n",
            "[46:01.440 --> 46:05.520]  And I talked to her about Kristen not wanting to be there, said, oh my God, that just sounds\n",
            "[46:05.520 --> 46:06.720]  like Todd last year.\n",
            "[46:06.720 --> 46:10.000]  He just wanted out of there, so bad.\n",
            "[46:10.000 --> 46:16.360]  But once he finished that year, it's like, I never said I didn't want to come back here.\n",
            "[46:16.360 --> 46:19.320]  So it's just a transitional phase, I think.\n",
            "[46:19.320 --> 46:24.920]  And I think with my other two, they were really entrenched in swim team, and they swam for\n",
            "[46:24.920 --> 46:25.920]  their colleges.\n",
            "[46:25.920 --> 46:31.120]  So you kind of have a built-in network of fast friends that you blood, sweat, and tears\n",
            "[46:31.120 --> 46:34.680]  with, so it's very much of a bonding thing.\n",
            "[46:34.680 --> 46:40.840]  And for other kids going to college, you have to work to build your network of friends.\n",
            "[46:40.840 --> 46:41.960]  It's not automatic.\n",
            "[46:41.960 --> 46:45.600]  And although she could have swam on the swim team and they asked her to, at Cal Poly, I\n",
            "[46:45.600 --> 46:48.600]  think maybe she was a little swimming burned out.\n",
            "[46:48.600 --> 46:49.600]  She wasn't always happy.\n",
            "[46:49.600 --> 46:55.040]  Can't per she wanted to, after being there for an early year, she wanted to go to another\n",
            "[46:55.040 --> 46:56.680]  school to travel more.\n",
            "[46:56.680 --> 47:00.640]  She wanted to go to school overseas.\n",
            "[47:00.640 --> 47:03.160]  She had all these grandiose ideas.\n",
            "[47:03.160 --> 47:05.960]  At least they'd put that way to me at the time.\n",
            "[47:05.960 --> 47:11.120]  In early May of 1996, with just a few weeks left of the spring quarter, Denise sent her\n",
            "[47:11.120 --> 47:15.560]  daughter a letter, reminding her that she had a world of opportunities at her fingertips\n",
            "[47:15.560 --> 47:19.840]  – energy her to learn from her mistakes and finish out the semester.\n",
            "[47:19.840 --> 47:21.960]  Yeah, I do remember writing it.\n",
            "[47:21.960 --> 47:27.560]  It's probably the last letter she got from us, so that's kind of hard.\n",
            "[47:27.560 --> 47:31.280]  And like, you know, everybody's mentioned before, she was smart enough, kid, but it's\n",
            "[47:31.280 --> 47:34.560]  like, I think she's trying to do too much at one time, so you learn from your mistakes.\n",
            "[47:34.560 --> 47:37.360]  You have to prioritize what's really important.\n",
            "[47:37.360 --> 47:40.160]  And you're in school, not turn a lot of money.\n",
            "[47:40.160 --> 47:45.040]  You're in school so that you can, in the future, have a career that you like and earn\n",
            "[47:45.040 --> 47:46.280]  your money.\n",
            "[47:46.280 --> 47:54.240]  So I think she tried to take on too much and didn't really prioritize the academic piece\n",
            "[47:54.240 --> 47:55.240]  of it.\n",
            "[47:55.240 --> 47:58.760]  I don't have any issues of – I mean, kids go off to college, you don't know what they're\n",
            "[47:58.760 --> 47:59.760]  doing.\n",
            "[47:59.760 --> 48:03.560]  So she certainly didn't write and tell me, oh, I went and did this or anything.\n",
            "[48:03.560 --> 48:08.320]  So it was – parents got a very modified version of what's going on.\n",
            "[48:08.320 --> 48:12.320]  And the version I got was, well, I can't study that much because I have to go to work.\n",
            "[48:12.320 --> 48:13.320]  I have to get up, you don't understand.\n",
            "[48:13.320 --> 48:18.760]  I have to get up at 4.30 in the morning and say, re-prioritize.\n",
            "[48:18.760 --> 48:21.960]  So we weren't really there and we weren't helicopter parents.\n",
            "[48:21.960 --> 48:24.240]  Because she was, you know, 19.\n",
            "[48:24.240 --> 48:26.240]  She knew everything bad.\n",
            "[48:26.240 --> 48:30.320]  Did you remember the last time you saw her in person?\n",
            "[48:30.320 --> 48:36.440]  I do remember sitting on the bed in the hotel room with her and just kind of talking about\n",
            "[48:36.440 --> 48:39.560]  life, kind of in general.\n",
            "[48:39.560 --> 48:43.360]  And then we were going to go to her dorm later.\n",
            "[48:43.360 --> 48:45.360]  I think Stan took her back to her dorm.\n",
            "[48:45.360 --> 48:48.360]  And she said, but you have to wait a little while because I'm going to clean it up.\n",
            "[48:48.360 --> 48:51.760]  You're going to be so impressed how clean our room is.\n",
            "[48:51.760 --> 48:54.440]  And Crystal was gone that weekend.\n",
            "[48:54.440 --> 49:00.200]  So they talked about Lindsay could spend the night in the dorm with her.\n",
            "[49:00.200 --> 49:01.840]  It just didn't happen just because I don't know.\n",
            "[49:01.840 --> 49:06.200]  I think we went – what's the place where you go eat ribs mclinta?\n",
            "[49:06.200 --> 49:07.200]  Oh, it says that.\n",
            "[49:07.200 --> 49:08.200]  Yeah.\n",
            "[49:08.280 --> 49:13.720]  So I just got late and she went back to the hotel with us.\n",
            "[49:13.720 --> 49:18.880]  So it was probably whatever spring break was for them.\n",
            "[49:18.880 --> 49:22.400]  Probably March or something like that.\n",
            "[49:22.400 --> 49:28.240]  On May 22nd, Kristen wrote her last letter to her friend Anne Marie, who she hadn't\n",
            "[49:28.240 --> 49:31.680]  really kept in touch with after going away to college.\n",
            "[49:31.680 --> 49:37.000]  On stationery decorated with angels and cherubs, she expressed her condolences.\n",
            "[49:37.000 --> 49:41.920]  My mom died suddenly by suicide when I was a freshman in college at the end of my – we\n",
            "[49:41.920 --> 49:43.680]  were both freshmen at the same time.\n",
            "[49:43.680 --> 49:47.840]  I was in San Diego and she was in Cal Poly.\n",
            "[49:47.840 --> 49:51.960]  After Kristen went missing, her mom found this letter and she had written a sympathy\n",
            "[49:51.960 --> 49:56.920]  note to me and she actually had talked to her mom about it over the phone.\n",
            "[49:56.920 --> 50:02.600]  And Denise gave that to me about a month or so after Kristen went missing and it's\n",
            "[50:02.600 --> 50:09.320]  something I've held on to this day because it means so much of the words that she wrote\n",
            "[50:09.320 --> 50:16.520]  and how much she cared even though we were apart because we were both at different schools\n",
            "[50:16.520 --> 50:20.040]  and whatnot.\n",
            "[50:20.040 --> 50:24.360]  Pre-cell phone era, Kristen had a standing date to call home every Sunday night from\n",
            "[50:24.360 --> 50:27.880]  her dorm room to stay in touch with her family.\n",
            "[50:27.880 --> 50:33.720]  On Friday, May 24, the start of a three-day Memorial Day weekend, she made an unscheduled\n",
            "[50:33.720 --> 50:37.640]  phone call to her parents, who were out at the time.\n",
            "[50:37.640 --> 50:42.040]  She left a message on their answering machine that she had good news and would call back\n",
            "[50:42.040 --> 50:44.240]  on Sunday.\n",
            "[50:44.240 --> 50:47.720]  Stan and Denise Smart listened to the message later that night.\n",
            "[50:47.720 --> 50:50.880]  My wife actually had a message –\n",
            "[50:50.880 --> 50:52.520]  Good news, good news.\n",
            "[50:52.520 --> 50:57.520]  I don't even know how we found out along the way but we did find out that the call was\n",
            "[50:57.520 --> 50:58.520]  about.\n",
            "[50:58.520 --> 51:05.520]  She was concerned about a grade and they apparently had found a paper, you know, or a test and\n",
            "[51:05.520 --> 51:08.880]  she had a good score on it so she was excited about that.\n",
            "[51:08.880 --> 51:14.680]  Was it a biology or chemistry class or something where they hadn't couldn't find her final\n",
            "[51:14.680 --> 51:17.280]  so they had given her an incomplete?\n",
            "[51:17.280 --> 51:23.000]  And so I know she was, well we were talking about that beforehand because she didn't\n",
            "[51:23.000 --> 51:24.480]  like confronting people.\n",
            "[51:24.560 --> 51:30.160]  And I said, if you took the test, it's a responsibility to find it.\n",
            "[51:30.160 --> 51:35.280]  So don't feel bad that you put it in a wrong pile or did you put your name on it?\n",
            "[51:35.280 --> 51:39.200]  And she said it was a Scantron so you had to fill out your name.\n",
            "[51:39.200 --> 51:40.120]  So her name was on it.\n",
            "[51:40.120 --> 51:44.440]  So I heard afterwards, I don't know if it was from me, I don't know how we found out\n",
            "[51:44.440 --> 51:49.880]  but we found out that that's what the good news, the good news was.\n",
            "[51:49.880 --> 51:55.800]  So if you only knew that and what you knew now, you know, it just...\n",
            "[51:55.800 --> 52:03.000]  It's a nice, nice community, wonderful people and I can't think of a safer location.\n",
            "[52:03.000 --> 52:08.600]  However, it's just like any location there are one or two people that can destroy someone's\n",
            "[52:08.600 --> 52:10.880]  life so things can change overnight.\n",
            "[52:14.280 --> 52:18.960]  That Friday evening, after making the phone call, Kristin got dressed and ready to go out\n",
            "[52:18.960 --> 52:21.320]  with friends for the night.\n",
            "[52:21.320 --> 52:27.920]  After settling on a gray crop top, black shorts and a pair of red Puma brand shoes, she left\n",
            "[52:27.920 --> 52:33.680]  mere hall with her friend Margarita Campos who lived in the room next door to hers.\n",
            "[52:33.680 --> 52:38.800]  She didn't bring her ID or money with her and she had lost her room key so she was depending\n",
            "[52:38.800 --> 52:42.920]  on Margarita's key to get them back into the dorm building that night.\n",
            "[52:42.920 --> 52:47.760]  They ran into two other girls in the hall who were also looking for something to do.\n",
            "[52:47.760 --> 52:51.640]  So the four of them flagged down a guy in a truck they knew and asked him to drive\n",
            "[52:51.640 --> 52:55.360]  them around to find an off-campus party to attend.\n",
            "[52:55.360 --> 53:01.560]  As a side note, Kristin was afraid to drive and never got her own driver's license.\n",
            "[53:01.560 --> 53:05.920]  Margarita Campos was probably Kristin's only close friend at Cal Poly.\n",
            "[53:05.920 --> 53:10.480]  They bonded over their ADD and spent a lot of time in Margarita's room talking about\n",
            "[53:10.480 --> 53:13.960]  boys and making cassette mixtapes.\n",
            "[53:13.960 --> 53:19.080]  I tried to get in contact with Margarita for a few months through social media and email\n",
            "[53:19.080 --> 53:23.480]  and when those were unsuccessful through cold calling her.\n",
            "[53:23.480 --> 53:27.600]  I left her a few messages and never heard back so I figured that she wasn't interested\n",
            "[53:27.600 --> 53:30.400]  in talking to me but I was wrong.\n",
            "[53:34.320 --> 53:35.320]  Hello.\n",
            "[53:35.320 --> 53:36.600]  Hi, this is Kristin.\n",
            "[53:36.600 --> 53:37.600]  It is.\n",
            "[53:37.600 --> 53:38.600]  Hi, Kristin.\n",
            "[53:38.600 --> 53:39.600]  This is Margarita.\n",
            "[53:39.600 --> 53:40.680]  Sorry, I didn't get back too soon.\n",
            "[53:40.680 --> 53:45.480]  The story of Kristin's last night has been told many times and through small inaccuracies\n",
            "[53:45.480 --> 53:51.080]  and early news stories, the details have become mixed up and embellished over the years.\n",
            "[53:51.080 --> 53:55.480]  So I asked Margarita to walk me through her memory of that night from how they decided\n",
            "[53:55.480 --> 54:00.240]  to go out looking for a party in the first place right up to the last time she ever saw\n",
            "[54:00.240 --> 54:01.240]  Kristin.\n",
            "[54:01.240 --> 54:05.960]  So that night, she was hanging in my room and I was kind of stressed out so I was like,\n",
            "[54:05.960 --> 54:09.080]  oh my gosh, I have this biology final and I hated biology at the time.\n",
            "[54:09.080 --> 54:12.560]  I ended up switching my major but that said, I was like stressed out and she's like,\n",
            "[54:12.560 --> 54:15.400]  oh God, what are we going to do tonight?\n",
            "[54:15.400 --> 54:16.880]  And I was like, I don't know, nothing.\n",
            "[54:16.880 --> 54:17.880]  I'm going to do nothing.\n",
            "[54:17.880 --> 54:19.720]  I'm going to study.\n",
            "[54:19.720 --> 54:22.400]  And she's like, oh, come on, we have to do something so that's where she brought her\n",
            "[54:22.400 --> 54:27.600]  music and she was like, oh, can I use your, I had a double cassette tape so you can make\n",
            "[54:27.600 --> 54:29.160]  a recording of music?\n",
            "[54:29.160 --> 54:33.600]  And so she's like, oh, I'm going to make a recording of this or something as we were\n",
            "[54:33.600 --> 54:34.600]  listening to music.\n",
            "[54:34.600 --> 54:38.080]  And that's why in my mind, I just think of Cindy Lauper this year, true colors.\n",
            "[54:40.080 --> 54:47.080]  I remember her like almost telling me, come on Margarita, we're going to go out.\n",
            "[54:47.080 --> 54:49.000]  Like you can't just stay here.\n",
            "[54:49.000 --> 54:50.880]  Like we have to go out.\n",
            "[54:50.880 --> 54:57.120]  And I was like, oh God, okay, it's almost like she wasn't going to let me stay home.\n",
            "[54:57.120 --> 54:58.240]  She wanted me to go.\n",
            "[54:58.240 --> 55:02.120]  And then somehow we connected with the girls down the hallway and they were all the way\n",
            "[55:02.120 --> 55:05.840]  down the hallway and I guess one of the girls was like, someone's going to pick us up and\n",
            "[55:05.840 --> 55:06.840]  we're going to go to some party.\n",
            "[55:06.840 --> 55:10.560]  I don't know if it was a party or a get together or something, but we went down, ended up\n",
            "[55:10.560 --> 55:15.000]  all piling up in this truck and driving to some like residential home.\n",
            "[55:15.000 --> 55:19.160]  At a house off of Foothill Boulevard, they sat and watched a few guys play video games\n",
            "[55:19.160 --> 55:25.600]  for a while before they decided it was in Kristen's words, a dud, not how she wanted\n",
            "[55:25.600 --> 55:26.600]  to spend her Friday night.\n",
            "[55:26.600 --> 55:30.120]  It was a dud and Kristen was like, oh my God, this is such a dud.\n",
            "[55:30.120 --> 55:32.000]  Like we are leaving, you know?\n",
            "[55:32.000 --> 55:34.440]  I think they gave us beer.\n",
            "[55:34.440 --> 55:38.600]  And that's what I think like we'd only had one beer when I left her.\n",
            "[55:38.600 --> 55:43.680]  They went back to driving around in the truck for a while, looking for a better party.\n",
            "[55:43.680 --> 55:47.280]  Because it was Memorial Day weekend though, a lot of students had left town to stay with\n",
            "[55:47.280 --> 55:50.360]  their families and the parties were scant.\n",
            "[55:50.360 --> 55:52.720]  That night was such a chill night.\n",
            "[55:52.720 --> 55:58.040]  Like it was such a quiet night in San Luis Vivo and it was just like a couple of us driving\n",
            "[55:58.040 --> 55:59.560]  around a truck around town.\n",
            "[55:59.560 --> 56:03.440]  I'm pretty sure Kristen was the one who said, just drop Marguerite and I off here because\n",
            "[56:03.440 --> 56:05.920]  we're just going to keep walking around.\n",
            "[56:05.920 --> 56:07.600]  We're going to keep walking around.\n",
            "[56:07.600 --> 56:10.240]  I'm pretty sure it was California and foothill.\n",
            "[56:10.240 --> 56:14.040]  Kristen and Marguerite walked around for a bit, eventually ending up near the unofficial\n",
            "[56:14.040 --> 56:19.120]  frat houses surrounding the Cal Poly campus where there had to be at least one party going\n",
            "[56:19.120 --> 56:20.920]  on.\n",
            "[56:20.920 --> 56:25.040]  Marguerite followed Kristen into the parking lot of the Foothill-Hossie into apartments\n",
            "[56:25.040 --> 56:30.200]  at 190 California Boulevard before she started to get tired of looking.\n",
            "[56:30.200 --> 56:35.200]  You were in the parking lot and she walked across the parking lot to cut over to Crandall.\n",
            "[56:35.200 --> 56:38.440]  I was like, I'm cool.\n",
            "[56:38.440 --> 56:41.920]  I had a pee and I was like, I remember that very good.\n",
            "[56:41.920 --> 56:43.360]  I really have to pee, Kristen.\n",
            "[56:43.360 --> 56:46.160]  She's like, just go here in the bushes.\n",
            "[56:46.160 --> 56:47.320]  Just go pee right here.\n",
            "[56:47.320 --> 56:49.320]  I was like, no, I want to go back.\n",
            "[56:49.320 --> 56:50.320]  I'm tired.\n",
            "[56:50.320 --> 56:52.800]  I don't think there's any parties.\n",
            "[56:52.800 --> 56:54.200]  I don't think there's any parties.\n",
            "[56:54.200 --> 56:56.640]  She's like, well, let's just try this street.\n",
            "[56:56.640 --> 56:57.880]  Let's just try this street.\n",
            "[56:58.880 --> 57:00.560]  I was like, I don't want to.\n",
            "[57:00.560 --> 57:02.640]  I just became a certain person.\n",
            "[57:02.640 --> 57:05.400]  I put my foot down and I just want to go back.\n",
            "[57:05.400 --> 57:06.960]  She was like, I'm just going to walk this way.\n",
            "[57:06.960 --> 57:07.960]  I was like, please.\n",
            "[57:07.960 --> 57:08.960]  She's like, please.\n",
            "[57:08.960 --> 57:12.880]  We had this sort of like, please, no, you please, no, you please.\n",
            "[57:12.880 --> 57:15.040]  But just like really quick, Marguerite, really quick.\n",
            "[57:15.040 --> 57:16.880]  I was like, no, Kristen, I don't want to.\n",
            "[57:16.880 --> 57:22.840]  I think she was so determined to find a party and I was so over it.\n",
            "[57:22.840 --> 57:24.840]  She wanted to find that party.\n",
            "[57:24.840 --> 57:26.520]  She's begging me and begging me.\n",
            "[57:26.520 --> 57:32.080]  I was like, well, as long as you get home safely, so I gave her my key because I knew\n",
            "[57:32.080 --> 57:36.400]  that by the time I walked back to the dorm, the doors would still be open.\n",
            "[57:36.400 --> 57:38.160]  But if she took any longer, the doors would be closed.\n",

            "[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:01.640]  Great talk to me, great meeting you.\n",
            "[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:03.680]  Bye.\n",
            "[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:08.160]  Trevor is important to the story, not just because he can give me insight into what Swampy\n",
            "[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:13.560]  Fells party looked like and who else was there, but also because he talked to Kristen\n",
            "[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:20.800]  several times at the party.\n",
            "[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:25.120]  The following Thursday, I'm driving on the Los Angeles freeway to Trevor's house in\n",

            "[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:32.400]  My car broke down a week before and while it's in the shop, the only car available to rent\n",
            "[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:36.160]  was a white 2019 Mustang convertible.\n",
            "[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:40.160]  I'm a little embarrassed that this is going to be his first impression of me, but it's\n",
            "[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:47.480]  better than postponing our meeting.\n",
            "[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:51.800]  When I pull up in front of his house, the car projects a lit up Mustang logo onto the\n",

            "[01:07:54.400 --> 01:08:01.400]  I'm not sure what the purpose of this feature is, except to add insult to injury.\n",
            "[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:49.040]  We sit down in his office, which is covered in every type of Beatles memorabilia you can\n",
            "[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.040]  imagine.\n",
            "[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:57.240]  Records, toys, autographs, and a series of giant wall panels that make up their faces.\n",
            "[01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:02.520]  Trevor's dog Fox, an American Eskimo, sits on the floor in front of him.\n",
            "[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:06.160]  You'll hear him panting every once in a while.\n",

            "[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  Would you lay down?\n",
            "[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.560]  I don't know where he gets all that energy.\n",
            "[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:28.000]  Dom and I told me earlier in the day, hey, we're swampy having this birthday party.\n",
            "[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.960]  We're having a small get together at the Crandall House.\n",
            "[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:37.920]  My memory serves me that I got there around 10, 10, 15, and Kristen Smart was already\n",
            "[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:38.920]  there.\n",
            "[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:40.920]  It wasn't a big party.\n",
            "[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:43.920]  Did you just want me to continue with the story?\n",
            "[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:44.920]  How many people?\n",
            "[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:48.840]  Well, when I walked in there, I would think maybe there wasn't more than like 12 or 15.\n",
            "[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:50.280]  I mean, it was not a lot.\n",
            "[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:51.280]  And at the most?\n",
            "[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:54.920]  Well, then at the most towards the end of the night, right around the time when I last\n",
            "[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:58.680]  saw Kristen before she went inside, it doubled or if not quadrupled.\n",
            "[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:00.640]  So it was between like 30 and like 45 people.\n",
            "[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:03.880]  I just remember there was a ton of people outside in the backyard.\n",
            "[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:05.440]  Fish would have been blank, right?\n",
            "[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:06.440]  It would have been a lot of fish.\n",
            "[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:07.760]  Probably would have been Grateful Dead.\n",
            "[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:10.320]  It probably would have been Dave Matthews, I would think.\n",
            "[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:13.000]  But definitely that house is a big jam van house.\n",
            "[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  They liked the dead.\n",
            "[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  They liked fish.\n",
            "[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.320]  It wasn't your hits of the day.\n",
            "[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:20.960]  It wasn't like, you know, who do you know the blowfish?\n",
            "[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:25.360]  You know, whatever it was at the time, or seal, or no, it would be definitely like all my\n",
            "[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:29.520]  brothers, Grateful Dead, fish, primarily fish.\n",
            "[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:32.480]  Those guys all, this to this day, they all love fish.\n",
            "[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:35.920]  So that would have been what was playing.\n",
            "[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:39.160]  When you walk into the Crandall house there, when you walked into the left, there was a\n",
            "[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:40.160]  pool table.\n",
            "[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:43.920]  Okay, so there's a pool table right there.\n",
            "[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.680]  And then there was a little half bar.\n",
            "[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:47.800]  It was like a bar.\n",
            "[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:50.960]  And there were like two or three stool seats.\n",
            "[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:52.640]  I remember for sure there's two seats.\n",
            "[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:55.040]  There might have been three stools.\n",
            "[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:56.920]  So I see my friends and they're like, hey, do you want to beer?\n",
            "[01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:59.200]  And I think my memory is that I had a Budweiser.\n",
            "[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:04.960]  So I would have been sitting first stool and then Dom sitting next to me.\n",
            "[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:05.960]  So I walked in.\n",
            "[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:09.440]  You know, and I didn't even notice Kristen, right?\n",
            "[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:13.960]  She walks over and this is exactly how this happens.\n",
            "[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:14.960]  So she walks over.\n",
            "[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:17.360]  She is wearing vinyl shorts.\n",
            "[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.200]  She's wearing a mid-ref shirt.\n",
            "[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:22.800]  Obviously, she's very, very pretty.\n",
            "[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:24.600]  She walks up to me.\n",
            "[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:29.280]  I think she might have said, hi, I'm Roxy and I went high and then she kisses me.\n",
            "[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:31.200]  Like full on the mouth with tongue.\n",
            "[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.360]  Like full on kisses me.\n",
            "[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:33.920]  And I'm like, huh?\n",
            "[01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:36.560]  She grabs my hand and takes me to the bathroom.\n",
            "[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:41.200]  And I'm like, I had heard stories about the Crandall way bathroom that like, you know,\n",
            "[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:42.720]  crazy, crazy sex happens.\n",
            "[01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:44.480]  And I was like, oh my God, it might be one of those stories.\n",
            "[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:45.480]  I don't know who this girl is.\n",
            "[01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:46.480]  Oh my God.\n",
            "[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:47.480]  You know, she pulls me in there.\n",
            "[01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:50.600]  And I remember it was dark for a second and then she finds the lights and she immediately\n",
            "[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:54.200]  walks over to the mirror and starts smoothing out her makeup.\n",
            "[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:56.200]  And she says, do you think I'm ugly?\n",
            "[01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:58.640]  And I'm like, no.\n",
            "[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:01.520]  And then I started to like look at her and she's like, the way she was like, but do you\n",
            "[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:02.520]  think I'm ugly?\n",
            "[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:03.520]  Do you think I'm ugly?\n",
            "[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:04.520]  And I'm like, no.\n",
            "[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:05.520]  And I was starting to get more of a sense of who this girl was.\n",
            "[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:08.400]  And I'm like, okay, there's no shenanigans that are going on in here.\n",
            "[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:09.920]  And she goes, okay, I have to go.\n",
            "[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:10.920]  I got to use the bathroom.\n",
            "[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:11.920]  Okay.\n",
            "[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:12.920]  And I'm like, oh, okay, cool.\n",
            "[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:16.360]  I'm like, I don't even know how I got here.\n",
            "[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:20.160]  Trevor thinks Kristen's only motivation for pulling him into the bathroom was to make\n",
            "[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:22.440]  another guy jealous.\n",
            "[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:26.600]  Almost as soon as the door had closed, she asked him who she should hook up with.\n",
            "[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:31.400]  A tall basketball player, who Trevor had been talking to when she approached him.\n",
            "[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:34.240]  Or another guy who he didn't know at all.\n",
            "[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.240]  It's not what Trevor was hoping for.\n",
            "[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:38.120]  And he's not about to give up that easily.\n",
            "[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:40.040]  I go, well, I'd pick me, right?\n",
            "[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:42.360]  This is the first thing if she goes, uh-huh.\n",
            "[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:43.360]  Yeah.\n",
            "[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.360]  You know, well, she's doing her makeup.\n",
            "[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:45.880]  And I'm like, okay.\n",
            "[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:50.120]  So Kristen's clearly not interested in doing anything more with Trevor.\n",
            "[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:51.920]  According to him, nothing else happened.\n",
            "[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:54.240]  And Kristen kicked him out after about a minute.\n",
            "[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:58.880]  So I go and I sit down at the stool and Dom is like, dude, what is going on with vinyl\n",
            "[01:12:58.880 --> 01:12:59.880]  chick?\n",
            "[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:02.600]  And that's the guys, the part of your calling your vinyl chick because she was wearing\n",
            "[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:04.200]  vinyl shorts.\n",
            "[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:08.120]  She polyester, most likely based on everything I've learned.\n",
            "[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:10.760]  Roxy Quicksilver brand board shorts.\n",
            "[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:15.520]  Not all that unusual for Cal Poly in May, but the guys at the party certainly noticed,\n",
            "[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:22.680]  referring to them variously as vinyl, nylon, spandex, bicycle shorts, even a black skirt\n",
            "[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:24.880]  in early news reports.\n",
            "[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:29.520]  Much of the early investigation focused on Kristen's appearance and behavior at the\n",
            "[01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:30.760]  party.\n",
            "[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:33.440]  Trevor had one more encounter with her before he left that night.\n",
            "[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:37.560]  Out in the backyard, she comes up again and they're all, leave him alone, leave him alone,\n",
            "[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:38.560]  Roxy.\n",
            "[01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:39.560]  And I'm like, no, no, no.\n",
            "[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:40.560]  And she's like, please talk to me.\n",
            "[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:43.400]  And now she's like really like an aberrated.\n",
            "[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:44.400]  She goes, come back here, talk to me.\n",
            "[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:45.400]  And she's like, he hates me.\n",
            "[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:47.320]  And I'm like, no, no.\n",
            "[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:51.440]  She's referring to the basketball player who she apparently had tried to flirt with, but\n",
            "[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:53.240]  had been rebuffed by.\n",
            "[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:56.880]  And then I said to her, I'm like, geez, you know, dude, what is your sign?\n",
            "[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:57.880]  Right?\n",
            "[01:13:57.960 --> 01:13:59.440]  I'm like, oh, astrology.\n",
            "[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.480]  I was like, yeah, I was 20.\n",
            "[01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:02.480]  And she goes, Pisces.\n",
            "[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:04.640]  I go, I am a Pisces.\n",
            "[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:05.640]  What's her birthday?\n",

            "[2095.96 - 2101.8399999999997]  I really didn't have the facility to cook there later I did.\n",
            "[2101.84 - 2109.08]  But I think it was difficult for her to socialize in that she didn't have a place to meet friends\n",

            "[2268.9599999999996 - 2272.3999999999996]  And Kristen and I got placed together, meeting her.\n",
            "[2272.3999999999996 - 2274.16]  She was a tall, beautiful one.\n",

            "[2283.3599999999997 - 2288.7999999999997]  And I remember Kristen being somewhere that actually was a big support to me during that\n",

            "[2299.56 - 2301.3599999999997]  And she was just a sweet girl, you know.\n",

            "[2343.2799999999997 - 2346.52]  Like anybody would be around and she'd be the person that's not being automatically\n",
            "[2346.52 - 2351.04]  your eyes would go straight to Kristen because she just had that look.\n",
            "[2351.04 - 2356.96]  We'd go to Waimea and we'd get shaped by the kids.\n",
            "[2356.96 - 2359.92]  Which is fun zone 24-7, right?\n",
            "[2359.92 - 2365.76]  Um, where I was more kind of the nurturing mother's side to you is very like mellow.\n",
            "[2365.76 - 2366.76]  It's all good.\n",
            "[2366.76 - 2367.76]  It's good.\n",

            "[2387.8 - 2392.32]  And then winter reunion, we had a winter reunion like between Christmas and New Year.\n",
            "[2392.32 - 2394.7200000000003]  I think actually went over New Year's.\n",
            "[2394.7200000000003 - 2397.7200000000003]  It's a smaller version of camp, not as many kids.\n",
            "[2397.7200000000003 - 2403.0]  And then we were getting ready to go back in June to be a counselor's camp.\n",
            "[2403.0 - 2406.7200000000003]  And I know she'd been hired because I was working at the camp and we were going to be\n",
            "[2406.7200000000003 - 2409.6800000000003]  co-councer again and that whole summer was kind of this.\n",

            "[2441.96 - 2446.64]  Attending San Joaquin Delta College for extra credits to increase her chances of being\n",

            "[2449.88 - 2450.96]  It worked.\n",
            "[2450.96 - 2455.88]  She was accepted to UC Santa Barbara and had already paid a deposit for a dorm room there\n",
            "[2455.88 - 2461.6]  when she abruptly decided that she would rather attend somewhere a little closer to home.\n",
            "[2461.6 - 2467.36]  So after returning from Oahu, Kristen moved from Stockton to San Luis Obispo to study\n",
            "[2467.36 - 2474.44]  at California Polytechnic State University, known to students and locals as Cal Poly,\n",
            "[2474.44 - 2478.76]  where she originally intended to major in architecture, but later switched to communication\n",
            "[2478.76 - 2484.8]  studies with the goal of traveling the world as a reporter like Joan London.\n",
            "[2484.8 - 2488.36]  Here again, her friend Roxie from Stockton.\n",
            "[2488.36 - 2490.8]  We stayed close until she left for school.\n",
            "[2490.8 - 2495.8]  I don't do therapy too often, but I'm in PT right now because I just had a baby, you\n",
            "[2495.8 - 2497.6800000000003]  know, some weird things have been popping up.\n",
            "[2497.6800000000003 - 2501.7200000000003]  You've ever had mouth treatment before where they put your hand in your mouth?\n",
            "[2501.7200000000003 - 2504.1200000000003]  They do all your muscles?\n",
            "[2504.1200000000003 - 2508.36]  A memory popped back in my head maybe too because you had called me.\n",
            "[2508.36 - 2512.88]  She was going off to college and she did not want to come back to Stockton.\n",
            "[2512.88 - 2521.7200000000003]  She just wanted to become an architect and live overseas and kind of just become free.\n",
            "[2521.7200000000003 - 2525.44]  She told me she wouldn't be calling me too much when she left for school, which was heartbreaking\n",
            "[2525.44 - 2528.4]  because I was a senior at the time.\n",
            "[2528.4 - 2531.36]  So I didn't talk to her when she was in school at all.\n",
            "[2531.36 - 2537.08]  I guess that's kind of common when you leave a town like Stockton.\n",
            "[2537.08 - 2542.68]  But the neat thing, you know, my husband said that I didn't peak in high school.\n",
            "[2542.68 - 2547.04]  Well, I'd say that Kristen didn't peak in high school, you know what I'm saying?\n",
            "[2547.04 - 2548.84]  She had her life to peak.\n",
            "[2548.84 - 2554.28]  I think that it was her time to, you know, get her architect degree and stay the world,\n",
            "[2554.28 - 2555.92]  you know.\n",
            "[2555.92 - 2560.1200000000003]  Because she enrolled late, she missed her chance to get a dorm room on campus.\n",
            "[2560.1200000000003 - 2566.6000000000004]  So she moved into the Stinner Glen Apartments at 1050 East Foothill Boulevard, now known\n",
            "[2566.6000000000004 - 2568.48]  as the slow.\n",
            "[2568.48 - 2571.76]  So she had a really nice roommate there.\n",
            "[2571.76 - 2577.84]  I thought she was nice, but she came from a very small, very sheltered kind of background.\n",
            "[2577.84 - 2582.52]  So it wasn't an unhappy dorm relationship.\n",
            "[2582.52 - 2584.2000000000003]  She just wanted to be on campus.\n",
            "[2584.2000000000003 - 2588.7200000000003]  And so her name from the get-go was on the waiting list.\n",
            "[2588.7200000000003 - 2594.04]  When she returned to Cal Poly after spending Christmas 1995 with friends back at Camp Mokulea\n",
            "[2594.04 - 2600.52]  Iya, she moved into room 120 at Mirahall, one of six historic residence halls known as\n",
            "[2600.52 - 2602.0]  the Red bricks.\n",
            "[2602.0 - 2605.96]  When she got the call that she could go, she had to give 30 days, I think, to Stinner\n",
            "[2605.96 - 2606.96]  Glen.\n",
            "[2607.96 - 2609.6]  And then I didn't help move her.\n",
            "[2609.6 - 2615.2400000000002]  She somehow probably found someone with a car or something, but she got resettled.\n",
            "[2615.2400000000002 - 2616.64]  And she said, oh, it's so much better.\n",
            "[2616.64 - 2621.2]  I can walk to class because, you know, Stinner Glen is not right next door.\n",
            "[2621.2 - 2626.52]  Acclimating the life on campus, Kristen worked to reinvent herself, using nicknames like\n",
            "[2626.52 - 2633.04]  Kiana or Marisol in her emails, and dying her naturally blonde hair brown.\n",
            "[2633.04 - 2635.56]  She still called her parents every Sunday, though.\n",
            "[2635.56 - 2639.08]  And they traveled down to San Luis Obispo several times to visit her.\n",
            "[2639.08 - 2645.84]  We probably went down after the Christmas holidays, and we went down after Easter vacation\n",
            "[2645.84 - 2648.24]  because we'd gone on a trip with the kids.\n",
            "[2648.24 - 2650.68]  That's when I saw the brown hair.\n",
            "[2650.68 - 2653.64]  She told me about the brown hair in Santa Picture, but it's seeing in person.\n",
            "[2653.64 - 2654.64]  I go, okay.\n",
            "[2654.64 - 2656.04]  She was like all children going away.\n",
            "[2656.04 - 2659.68]  They were rather independent when you get to college.\n",
            "[2659.68 - 2665.12]  Myself, my wife, and yourself, and everyone else knows that, you know?\n",
            "[2665.12 - 2667.64]  And it was like brown.\n",
            "[2667.64 - 2674.3999999999996]  But I think, you know, sometimes kids make their hair red or green or something.\n",
            "[2674.3999999999996 - 2676.04]  So how long she would have kept it?\n",
            "[2676.04 - 2678.08]  I don't really know.\n",
            "[2678.08 - 2682.68]  The college classes came as a bit more of a struggle for Kristen than high school had,\n",
            "[2682.68 - 2685.3199999999997]  and not long after moving into Mere Hall.\n",
            "[2685.3199999999997 - 2689.64]  She started to express doubts about whether Cal Poly was right for her.\n",
            "[2689.64 - 2694.8399999999997]  There were other places, she told her mother, like the University of the Virgin Islands,\n",
            "[2694.8399999999997 - 2698.72]  or Puerto Rico, where she could go to get a doctorate.\n",
            "[2698.72 - 2704.56]  When Denise came down to visit her in early 1996, Kristen broke down, begging her mother\n",
            "[2704.56 - 2707.6]  to let her drop out and go somewhere else.\n",
            "[2707.6 - 2711.3199999999997]  She really felt everyone was too much the same.\n",
            "[2711.3199999999997 - 2719.6]  And the reality is, freshman year is really hard year for many majority, I would say.\n",
            "[2719.6 - 2724.24]  It's a huge transition, being away from home, being responsible for your laundry, and having\n",
            "[2724.24 - 2725.24]  to do your homework.\n",
            "[2725.24 - 2728.7999999999997]  And she was working as a lifeguard, so she tried to get as many hours as she could at\n",
            "[2728.7999999999997 - 2729.7999999999997]  the pool.\n",
            "[2729.7999999999997 - 2737.16]  And of course, is the newbie, which hours are open, you know, the 5 and 6 AM hours.\n",
            "[2737.16 - 2740.92]  And she was like most teenagers at the time.\n",
            "[2740.92 - 2743.2]  They loved their sleep.\n",
            "[2743.2 - 2745.04]  So she was probably tired.\n",
            "[2745.04 - 2747.04]  She was fatigued and adjusting.\n",
            "[2748.04 - 2753.6]  But like I said, I don't think it's unusual for kids in their first year of college to,\n",
            "[2753.6 - 2761.44]  in fact, I had a friend whose son was a year ahead of Kristen, and he was at Pepperdine.\n",
            "[2761.44 - 2765.52]  And I talked to her about Kristen not wanting to be there, said, oh my God, that just sounds\n",
            "[2765.52 - 2766.72]  like Todd last year.\n",
            "[2766.72 - 2770.0]  He just wanted out of there, so bad.\n",
            "[2770.0 - 2776.36]  But once he finished that year, it's like, I never said I didn't want to come back here.\n",
            "[2776.36 - 2779.32]  So it's just a transitional phase, I think.\n",
            "[2779.32 - 2784.92]  And I think with my other two, they were really entrenched in swim team, and they swam for\n",

            "[2785.92 - 2791.1200000000003]  So you kind of have a built-in network of fast friends that you blood, sweat, and tears\n",
            "[2791.1200000000003 - 2794.6800000000003]  with, so it's very much of a bonding thing.\n",
            "[2794.6800000000003 - 2800.84]  And for other kids going to college, you have to work to build your network of friends.\n",
            "[2800.84 - 2801.96]  It's not automatic.\n",
            "[2801.96 - 2805.6]  And although she could have swam on the swim team and they asked her to, at Cal Poly, I\n",
            "[2805.6 - 2808.6]  think maybe she was a little swimming burned out.\n",
            "[2808.6 - 2809.6]  She wasn't always happy.\n",
            "[2809.6 - 2815.04]  Can't per she wanted to, after being there for an early year, she wanted to go to another\n",

            "[2816.68 - 2820.64]  She wanted to go to school overseas.\n",
            "[2820.64 - 2823.16]  She had all these grandiose ideas.\n",
            "[2823.16 - 2825.96]  At least they'd put that way to me at the time.\n",
